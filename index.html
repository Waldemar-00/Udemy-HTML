  <h1>Antoine de Saint-Exupery - The Little Prince</h1> 
   <p class='upper'>to leon werth</p>
  
   <p>I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children - although few of thspan class='italic' rspan class='italic'span class='italic'ber it. And so I correct my dedication:</p>

   <h2>I</h2>
   <p>Once, when I was six years old, I saw in the book <span class='italic'>True Stories of Nature</span class='italic'> a magnificent picture of a primeval forest. It was an image of a boa constrictor swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.</p>
   <img src="img\snake.jpg" alt="Snake">
   <p>The book says: <span class='italic'>“Boas swallow their prey whole without chewing it. After that, they are unable to move and sleep for the six months they need for digestion.”</span class='italic'></p>
   <p>But they answered: <span class='italic'>"Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</span class='italic'></p>
   <p>My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:

</p>
<img src="img\elephant.jpg" alt="Elephant">
<p>The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by thspan class='italic'selves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to thspan class='italic'.</p>
<p>So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.</p>
<p>In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen thspan class='italic' intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of thspan class='italic'.</p>
<p>Whenever I met one of thspan class='italic' who sespan class='italic'ed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"That is a hat."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.</p>
<hr>

<h2>II</h2>
<p>So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attspan class='italic'pt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.</p>
<p>The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazspan class='italic'ent, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"If you please--draw me a sheep!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'></span class='italic'>"Draw me a sheep!"</p>
<p>I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.
</p>
<img src="img\prince.jpg" alt="Prince">
<p>That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.</p>
<p>Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Rspan class='italic'span class='italic'ber, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man sespan class='italic'ed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But--what are you doing here?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"If you please--draw me a sheep..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might sespan class='italic' to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I rspan class='italic'span class='italic'bered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>So then I made a drawing.</p>
<img src="img\sheep.jpg" alt="Sheep">
<p>He looked at it carefully, then he said:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>So I made another drawing.</p>
<img src="img\sheep1.jpg" alt="Sheep">
<p>My friend smiled gently and indulgently.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>So then I did my drawing over once more.</p>
<p>But it was rejected too, just like the others.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."</span class='italic'></p>
<img src="img\sheep2.jpg" alt="Sheep">
<p>By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.</p>
<img src="img\box.jpg" alt="Box">
<p>And I threw out an explanation with it.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Why?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Because where I live everything is very small..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small sheep that I have given you."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>He bent his head over the drawing.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Not so small that--Look! He has gone to sleep..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.</p>
<hr>
<h2>III</h2>
<p>It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never sespan class='italic'ed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.</p>
<p>The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:
</p>
<img src="img\boyonrock.jpg" alt="Prince on the Rock">
<p><span class='italic'>"What is that object?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.</p>
<p>He cried out, then:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What! You dropped down from the sky?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Yes," I answered, modestly.</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Oh! That is funny!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Then he added:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I dspan class='italic'anded, abruptly:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Do you come from another planet?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contspan class='italic'plation of his treasure.

    You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the <span class='italic'>"other planets."</span class='italic'> I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.
    
    <span class='italic'>"My little man, where do you come from? What is this 'where I live,' of which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>After a reflective silence he answered:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>But the little prince sespan class='italic'ed shocked by this offer:</p>
<img src="img\boyonplanet.jpg" alt="Prince on Planet">
<p><span class='italic'>"Tie him! What a queer idea!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get lost."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>My friend broke into another peal of laughter:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But where do you think he would go?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Anywhere. Straight ahead of him."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>Then the little prince said, earnestly:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far..."</span class='italic'></p>
<hr>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p>I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house!</p>
<p>But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to the great planets--such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus--to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing thspan class='italic' through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, <span class='italic'>"Asteroid 325"</span class='italic'>.</p>
<p>I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.</p>
<p>This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909.
</p>
<img src="img\theacher.jpg" alt="Theacher">
<p>On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great dspan class='italic'onstration. But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said.</p>
<p>Grown-ups are like that...</p>
<p>Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his dspan class='italic'onstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody accepted his report.</p>
<img src="img\teacher1.jpg" alt="Teacher">
<p>If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell thspan class='italic' that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, <span class='italic'>"What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?"</span class='italic'> Instead, they dspan class='italic'and: <span class='italic'>"How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?"</span class='italic'> Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.</p>
<p>If you were to say to the grown-ups: <span class='italic'>"I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,"</span class='italic'> they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to thspan class='italic': <span class='italic'>"I saw a house that cost $20,000."</span class='italic'> Then they would exclaim: <span class='italic'>"Oh, what a pretty house that is!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>Just so, you might say to thspan class='italic': <span class='italic'>"The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists."</span class='italic'> And what good would it do to tell thspan class='italic' that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to thspan class='italic': <span class='italic'>"The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612,"</span class='italic'> then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.</p>
<img src="img\teacherblack.jpg" alt="Teacher">
<p>They are like that. One must not hold it against thspan class='italic'. Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people.</p>
<p>But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I should have like to say: <span class='italic'>"Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story.</p>
<p>For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down these mspan class='italic'ories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures...</p>
<p>It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resspan class='italic'blance to its subject. I make some errors, too, in the little prince's height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume. So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.</p>
<p>In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.
</p>
<hr>

<h2>V</h2>
<p>As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his departure from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs.</p>
<p>This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly--as if seized by a grave doubt-- <span class='italic'>"It is true, isn't it, that sheep eat little bushes?"</span class='italic'> </p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Yes, that is true."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Ah! I am glad!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.</p>
<p>The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"We would have to put thspan class='italic' one on top of the other,"</span class='italic'> he said.</p>
<img src="img\elephantsonplanet.jpg" alt="Elephants">
<p>But he made a wise comment:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"That is strictly correct," I said. "But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>He answered me at once,<span class='italic'> "Oh, come, come!"</span class='italic'>, as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problspan class='italic', without any assistance.</p>
<p>Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived--as on all planets--good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among thspan class='italic' is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin--timidly at first--to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun. If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.</p>
<img src="img\boydigs.jpg" alt="Boydigs">
<p>Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with thspan class='italic'. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces...</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is a question of discipline,"</span class='italic'> the little prince said to me later on. <span class='italic'>"When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resspan class='italic'ble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work," </span class='italic'> the little prince added, "but very easy."</p>
<p>And one day he said to me: <span class='italic'>"You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to thspan class='italic' if they were to travel some day. Sometimes," he added, "there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. <span class='italic'>"Children," I say plainly, "watch out for the baobabs!"</span class='italic'> </p>
<p>My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for thspan class='italic' that I have worked so hard over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.</p>
<img src="img\boyontree.jpg" alt="Boy on tree">
<p>Perhaps you will ask me, <span class='italic'>"Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?"</span class='italic'> </p>
<p>The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.</p>
<hr>

<h2>VI</h2>
<p>Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life... For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But we must wait," </span class='italic'> I said.</p>
<p>"Wait? For what?"</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Wait? For what?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>At first you sespan class='italic'ed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I am always thinking that I am at home!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France.</p>
<p>If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like...</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"One day," you said to me, "I saw the sunset forty-four times!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And a little later you added:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You know--one loves the sunset, when one is so sad..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Were you so sad, then?" I asked, "on the day of the forty-four sunsets?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>But the little prince made no reply.</p>
<img src="img\boyevening.jpg" alt="Boy evening">
<hr>
<h2>VII</h2>
<p>On the fifth day--again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep--the secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problspan class='italic', he dspan class='italic'anded:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"A sheep--if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>"A sheep," I answered, "eats anything it finds in its reach."</p>
<p>"Even flowers that have thorns?"</p>
<p>"Yes, even flowers that have thorns."</p>
<p>"Then the thorns--what use are they?"</p>
<p>I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extrspan class='italic'ely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The thorns--what use are they?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The thorns are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for spite!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Oh!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I don't believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are naďve. They reassure thspan class='italic'selves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: <span class='italic'>"If this bolt still won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer."</span class='italic'> Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"And you actually believe that the flowers--"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Oh, no!" I cried. "No, no, no! I don't believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came into my head. Don't you see--I am very busy with matters of consequence!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>He stared at me, thunderstruck.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Matters of consequence!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-grease, bending down over an object which sespan class='italic'ed to him extrspan class='italic'ely ugly...</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You talk just like the grown-ups!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You mix everything up together... You confuse everything..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentlspan class='italic'an. He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of consequence!' And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man--he is a mushroom!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"A what?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"A mushroom!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>The little prince was now white with rage.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating thspan class='italic' just the same. And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to thspan class='italic'? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important? Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentlspan class='italic'an's sums? And if I know--I, myself--one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing--Oh! You think that is not important!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>His face turned from white to red as he continued:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars. He can say to himself, 'Somewhere, my flower is there...' But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened... And you think that is not important!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>He could not say anything more. His words were choked by sobbing.</p>
<p>The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will--"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more.</p>
<p>It is such a secret place, the land of tears.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>
<p>I soon learned to know this flower better. On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet. It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab.</p>
<p>The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must span class='italic'erge from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colors with the greatest care. She dressed herself slowly. She adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies. It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature! And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days.</p>
<p>Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself.</p>
<img src="img\boyandflower.jpg" alt="Boy and Flower">
<p>And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Oh! How beautiful you are!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Am I not?" </span class='italic'> the flower responded, sweetly.<span class='italic'>"And I was born at the same moment as the sun..."</span class='italic'> </p>
<p>The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest--but how moving--and exciting--she was!</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I think it is time for breakfast," she added an instant later. "If you would have the kindness to think of my needs--"</span class='italic'></p>
<img src="img\boypour.jpg" alt="Boy pour">
<p>And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower.</p>
<p>So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity--which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Let the tigers come with their claws!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"There are no tigers on my planet," the little prince objected. "And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I am not a weed," the flower replied, sweetly.</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Please excuse me..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I am not at all afraid of tigers," she went on, "but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>"A horror of drafts--that is bad luck, for a plant," rspan class='italic'arked the little prince, and added to himself, "This flower is a very complex creature..."</p>
<img src="img\boyandbook.jpg" alt="Boy and book">
<p><span class='italic'>"At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where you live. In the place I came from--"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. span class='italic'barassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a naďve untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The screen?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from rspan class='italic'orse just the same.</p>
<p>So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I ought not to have listened to her," he confided to me one day. "One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at thspan class='italic' and breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace. This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity."</span class='italic'></p>
<img src="img\dog.jpg" alt="Dog">
<p>And he continued his confidences:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her... I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little strategspan class='italic's. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her..."</span class='italic'></p>

<h2>IX</h2>
<p>I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds. On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order. He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning. He also had one volcano that was extinct. But, as he said, "One never knows!" So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too. If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney.</p>
<p>On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes. That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us.</p>
<p>The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the last little shoots of the baobabs. He believed that he would never want to return. But on this last morning all these familiar tasks sespan class='italic'ed very precious to him. And when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realized that he was very close to tears.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Goodbye," </span class='italic'> he said to the flower.</p>
<p>But she made no answer.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Goodbye,"</span class='italic'> he said again.</p>
<p>The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I have been silly," </span class='italic'> she said to him, at last.<span class='italic'>"I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Of course I love you," the flower said to him. "It is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But you--you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy... Let the glass globe be. I don't want it any more."</span class='italic'></p>
<img src="img\boyonplanet1.jpg" alt="Boy on planet">
<p><span class='italic'>"But the wind--"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"My cold is not so bad as all that... The cool night air will do me good. I am a flower."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But the animals--"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies. It sespan class='italic's that they are very beautiful. And if not the butterflies--and the caterpillars--who will call upon me? You will be far away... As for the large animals--I am not at all afraid of any of thspan class='italic'. I have my claws."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And, naďvely, she showed her four thorns. Then she added:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Don't linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower.</p>

<h2>X</h2>
<p>He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330. He began, therefore, by visiting thspan class='italic', in order to add to his knowledge.</p>
<p>The first of thspan class='italic' was inhabited by a king. Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic.</p>
<img src="img\king.jpg" alt="King">
<p><span class='italic'>"Ah! Here is a subject,"</span class='italic'> exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming.</p>
<p>And the little prince asked himself:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>He did not know how the world is simplified for kings. To thspan class='italic', all men are subjects.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Approach, so that I may see you better,"</span class='italic'> said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody.</p>
<p>The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe. So he rspan class='italic'ained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king," </span class='italic'> the monarch said to him. <span class='italic'>"I forbid you to do so."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I can't help it. I can't stop myself,"</span class='italic'>replied the little prince, thoroughly span class='italic'barrassed. <span class='italic'>"I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Ah, then," </span class='italic'>the king said. <span class='italic'> "I order you to yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning. Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity. Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"That frightens me... I cannot, any more..."</span class='italic'> murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Hum! Hum!"</span class='italic'> replied the king. <span class='italic'> "Then I--I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to--"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>He sputtered a little, and sespan class='italic'ed vexed.</p>
<p>For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected. He tolerated no disobedience. He was an absolute monarch. But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"If I ordered a general," </span class='italic'>" he would say, by way of example, <span class='italic'> "if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"May I sit down?"</span class='italic'>came now a timid inquiry from the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I order you to do so,"</span class='italic'> the king answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle.

    But the little prince was wondering... The planet was tiny. Over what could this king really rule?</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Sire," </span class='italic'> he said to him, <span class='italic'>"I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question--"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I order you to ask me a question," </span class='italic'> the king hastened to assure him.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Sire--over what do you rule?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Over everything," </span class='italic'>said the king, with magnificent simplicity.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Over everything?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Over all that?" </span class='italic'> asked the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Over all that,"</span class='italic'>the king answered.</p>
<p>For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"And the stars obey you?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Certainly they do," the king said. "They obey instantly. I do not permit insubordination."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he rspan class='italic'span class='italic'bered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I should like to see a sunset... Do me that kindness... Order the sun to set..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?" the king dspan class='italic'anded. "The general, or myself?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince firmly.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Exactly. One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform," the king went on. "Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw thspan class='italic'selves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Then my sunset?" </span class='italic'> the little prince rspan class='italic'inded him: for he never forgot a question once he had asked it.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You shall have your sunset. I shall command it. But, according to my science of government, I shall wait until conditions are favorable."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"When will that be?"</span class='italic'> inquired the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Hum! Hum!" replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac. "Hum! Hum! That will be about--about--that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>The little prince yawned. He was regretting his lost sunset. And then, too, he was already beginning to be a little bored.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I have nothing more to do here," </span class='italic'> he said to the king <span class='italic'>"So I shall set out on my way again."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Do not go,"</span class='italic'> said the king, who was very proud of having a subject. <span class='italic'>"Do not go. I will make you a Minister!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Minister of what?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Minster of--of Justice!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But there is nobody here to judge!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"We do not know that,"</span class='italic'> the king said to him. <span class='italic'>"I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom. I am very old. There is no room here for a carriage. And it tires me to walk."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Oh, but I have looked already!"</span class='italic'>' said the little prince, turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet. On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all...</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Then you shall judge yourself," the king answered. "that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom."</span class='italic'></p>
<p> <span class='italic'>"Yes," </span class='italic'> said the little prince, <span class='italic'>"but I can judge myself anywhere. I do not need to live on this planet."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Hum! Hum!" said the king. "I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat. I hear him at night. You can judge this old rat. From time to time you will condspan class='italic'n him to death. Thus his life will depend on your justice. But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily. He is the only one we have."</span class='italic'></p>
<p> <span class='italic'>"I," </span class='italic'> replied the little prince, <span class='italic'>"do not like to condspan class='italic'n anyone to death. And now I think I will go on my way."</span class='italic'></p>
<p> <span class='italic'>"No," </span class='italic'> said the king.</p>
<p>But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed,"</span class='italic'> he said, <span class='italic'>"he should be able to give me a reasonable order. He should be able, for example, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute. It sespan class='italic's to me that conditions are favorable..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment. Then, with a sigh, he took his leave.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I make you my Ambassador,"</span class='italic'> the king called out, hastily.</p>
<p>He had a magnificent air of authority.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The grown-ups are very strange,"</span class='italic'> the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey.</p>
<hr>
<h2>XI</h2>
<p>The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man.</p>
<img src="img\rednose.jpg" alt="Man with red nose">
<p><span class='italic'>"Ah! Ah! I am about to receive a visit from an admirer!"</span class='italic'> he exclaimed from afar, when he first saw the little prince coming.</p>
<p>For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Good morning,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince. <span class='italic'>"That is a queer hat you are wearing."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is a hat for salutes,"</span class='italic'> the conceited man replied. <span class='italic'>"It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Yes?"</span class='italic'> said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Clap your hands, one against the other,"</span class='italic'> the conceited man now directed him.</p>
<p>The little prince clapped his hands. The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"This is more entertaining than the visit to the king,"</span class='italic'>the little prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other. The conceited man again raised his hat in salute. </p>
<p>After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game's monotony.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"And what should one do to make the hat come down?"</span class='italic'> he asked.</p>
<p>But the conceited man did not hear him. Conceited people never hear anything but praise.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Do you really admire me very much?"</span class='italic'> he dspan class='italic'anded of the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What does that mean--'admire'?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But you are the only man on your planet!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Do me this kindness. Admire me just the same."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I admire you," said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders slightly, "but what is there in that to interest you so much?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And the little prince went away.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The grown-ups are certainly very odd,"</span class='italic'> he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.</p>
<hr>

<h2>XII</h2>
<p>The next planet was inhabited by a tippler. This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What are you doing there?"</span class='italic'> he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of span class='italic'pty bottles and also a collection of full bottles.</p>
<img src="img\manandbottles.jpg" alt="Man and bottles">
<p><span class='italic'>"I am drinking,"</span class='italic'> replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Why are you drinking?"</span class='italic'> dspan class='italic'anded the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"So that I may forget,"</span class='italic'> replied the tippler.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Forget what?"</span class='italic'> inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Forget that I am ashamed,"</span class='italic'> the tippler confessed, hanging his head.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Ashamed of what?"</span class='italic'> insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Ashamed of drinking!"</span class='italic'> The tipler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence.</p>
<p>And the little prince went away, puzzled.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,"</span class='italic'> he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.</p>
<hr>

<h2>XIII</h2>
<p>The fourth planet belonged to a businessman. This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince's arrival.</p>
<img src="img\businessman.jpg" alt="Businessman">
<p><span class='italic'>"Good morning,"</span class='italic'> the little prince said to him. <span class='italic'>"Your cigarette has gone out."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Three and two make five. Five and seven make twelve. Twelve and three make fifteen. Good morning. FIfteen and seven make twenty-two. Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight. I haven't time to light it again. Twenty-six and five make thirty-one. Phew! Then that makes five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Five hundred million what?"</span class='italic'> asked the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Eh? Are you still there? Five-hundred-and-one million--I can't stop... I have so much to do! I am concerned with matters of consequence. I don't amuse myself with balderdash. Two and five make seven..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Five-hundred-and-one million what?"</span class='italic'> repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it.</p>
<p>The businessman raised his head.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"During the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I have been disturbed only three times. The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where. He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place, and I made four mistakes in my addition. The second time, eleven years ago, I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism. I don't get enough exercise. I have no time for loafing. The third time--well, this is it! I was saying, then, five-hundred-and-one millions--"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Millions of what?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>The businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Millions of those little objects,"</span class='italic'> he said, <span class='italic'>"which one sometimes sees in the sky."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Flies?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Oh, no. Little glittering objects."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Bees?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Oh, no. Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming. As for me, I am concerned with matters of consequence. There is no time for idle dreaming in my life."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Ah! You mean the stars?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Yes, that's it. The stars."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"And what do you do with five-hundred millions of stars?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one. I am concerned with matters of consequence: I am accurate."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"And what do you do with these stars?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What do I do with thspan class='italic'?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Yes."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Nothing. I own thspan class='italic'."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You own the stars?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Yes."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But I have already seen a king who--"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Kings do not own, they reign over. It is a very different matter."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"And what good does it do you to own the stars?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It does me the good of making me rich."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"And what good does it do you to be rich?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are discovered."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"This man," the little prince said to himself, "reasons a little like my poor tippler..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>Nevertheless, he still had some more questions.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"How is it possible for one to own the stars?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I don't know. To nobody."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Then they belong to me, because I was the first person to think of it."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Is that all that is necessary?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Certainly. When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you get an idea before any one else, you take out a patent on it: it is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning thspan class='italic'."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Yes, that is true," said the little prince. "And what do you do with thspan class='italic'?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I administer thspan class='italic'," replied the businessman. "I count thspan class='italic' and recount thspan class='italic'. It is difficult. But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>The little prince was still not satisfied.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"If I owned a silk scarf," he said, "I could put it around my neck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with me. But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"No. But I can put thspan class='italic' in the bank."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Whatever does that mean?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"And that is all?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>'"That is enough,"'</span class='italic'> said the businessman.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is entertaining," thought the little prince. "It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>On matters of consequence, the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grown-ups.</p>
<p>i
    "I myself own a flower," he continued his conversation with the businessman, "which I water every day. I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is extinct; one never knows). It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own thspan class='italic'. But you are of no use to the stars..."
</p>
<p>The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went away.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary,"</span class='italic'> he said simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey.
</p>

<h2>XIV</h2>
<p>The fifth planet was very strange. It was the smallest of all. There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamplighter. The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet which had no people, and not one house. But he said to himself, nevertheless:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It may well be that this man is absurd. But he is not so absurd as the king, the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler. For at least his work has some meaning. When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one flower. When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep. That is a beautiful occupation. And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Good morning. Why have you just put out your lamp?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Those are the orders,"</span class='italic'> replied the lamplighter. <span class='italic'>"Good morning."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What are the orders?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The orders are that I put out my lamp. Good evening."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And he lighted his lamp again.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But why have you just lighted it again?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Those are the orders,"</span class='italic'> replied the lamplighter.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I do not understand,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"There is nothing to understand,"</span class='italic'> said the lamplighter. <span class='italic'>"Orders are orders. Good morning."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And he put out his lamp.</p>
<p>Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"And the orders have been changed since that time?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The orders have not been changed," said the lamplighter. "That is the tragedy! From year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Then what?"</span class='italic'> asked the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Then--the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"That is very funny! A day lasts only one minute, here where you live!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is not funny at all!"</span class='italic'> said the lamplighter. <span class='italic'>"While we have been talking together a month has gone by."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"A month?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Yes, a month. Thirty minutes. Thirty days. Good evening."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And he lighted his lamp again.</p>
<p>As the little prince watched him, he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders. He rspan class='italic'span class='italic'bered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling up his chair; and he wanted to help his friend.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>You know," he said, "I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I always want to rest,"</span class='italic'> said the lamplighter.</p>
<p>For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time.</p>
<p>The little prince went on with his explanation:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. When you want to rest, you will walk--and the day will last as long as you like."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"That doesn't do me much good,"</span class='italic'> said the lamplighter. <span class='italic'> "The one thing I love in life is to sleep."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Then you're unlucky,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I am unlucky,"</span class='italic'> said the lamplighter. <span class='italic'>"Good morning."</span class='italic'></p>
<img src="img\flashlight.jpg" alt="Flashlight">
<p>And he put out his lamp.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"That man," said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, "that man would be scorned by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the businessman. Nevertheless he is the only one of thspan class='italic' all who does not sespan class='italic' to me ridiculous. Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>He breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"That man is the only one of thspan class='italic' all whom I could have made my friend. But his planet is indeed too small. There is no room on it for two people..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets!</p>
<hr>

<h2>XV</h2>
<p>The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one. It was inhabited by an old gentlspan class='italic'an who wrote voluminous books.</p>
<img src="img\maningreen.jpg" alt="Main in green">
<p><span class='italic'>"Oh, look! Here is an explorer!"</span class='italic'> he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming.</p>
<p>The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little. He had already traveled so much and so far!</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Where do you come from?"</span class='italic'> the old gentlspan class='italic'an said to him.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What is that big book?"</span class='italic'> said the little prince. <span class='italic'>"What are you doing?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I am a geographer,"</span class='italic'> said the old gentlspan class='italic'an.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What is a geographer?"</span class='italic'> asked the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts."</span class='italic'></p>
<p> <span class='italic'>"That is very interesting," </span class='italic'> said the little prince. <span class='italic'>"Here at last is a man who has a real profession!"</span class='italic'> And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer. It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Your planet is very beautiful," he said. "Has it any oceans?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I couldn't tell you,"</span class='italic'> said the geographer.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Ah!"</span class='italic'> The little prince was disappointed. <span class='italic'>"Has it any mountains?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I couldn't tell you,"</span class='italic'> said the geographer.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"And towns, and rivers, and deserts?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I couldn't tell you that, either."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But you are a geographer!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Exactly," the geographer said. "But I am not an explorer. I haven't a single explorer on my planet. It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts. The geographer is much too important to go loafing about. He does not leave his desk. But he receives the explorers in his study. He asks thspan class='italic' questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels. And if the recollections of any one among thspan class='italic' sespan class='italic' interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer's moral character."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Why is that?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer. So would an explorer who drank too much."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Why is that?"</span class='italic'> asked the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Because intoxicated men see double. Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I know some one,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince, <span class='italic'>"who would make a bad explorer."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"One goes to see it?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"No. That would be too complicated. But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs. For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitspan class='italic'ent.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But you--you come from far away! You are an explorer! You shall describe your planet to me!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And, having opened his big register, the geographer sharpened his pencil. The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil. One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting thspan class='italic' down in ink.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Well?"</span class='italic'> said the geographer expectantly.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Oh, where I live," said the little prince, "it is not very interesting. It is all so small. I have three volcanoes. Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct. But one never knows."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"One never knows,"</span class='italic'> said the geographer.</p>
<p>"I have also a flower."</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"We do not record flowers,"</span class='italic'> said the geographer.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Why is that? The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"We do not record thspan class='italic',"</span class='italic'> said the geographer, <span class='italic'>"because they are ephspan class='italic'eral."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What does that mean--'ephspan class='italic'eral'?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Geographies,"</span class='italic'> said the geographer, <span class='italic'>"are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position. It is very rarely that an ocean span class='italic'pties itself of its waters. We write of eternal things."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But extinct volcanoes may come to life again,"</span class='italic'> the little prince interrupted. <span class='italic'>"What does that mean-- 'ephspan class='italic'eral'?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us,"</span class='italic'> said the geographer. <span class='italic'>"The thing that matters to us is the mountain. It does not change."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But what does that mean--'ephspan class='italic'eral'?"</span class='italic'> repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked it.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It means, 'which is in danger of speedy disappearance.'"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Certainly it is."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"My flower is ephspan class='italic'eral,"</span class='italic'> the little prince said to himself, <span class='italic'>"and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>That was his first moment of regret. But he took courage once more.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What place would you advise me to visit now?"</span class='italic'> he asked.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The planet Earth,"</span class='italic'> replied the geographer. <span class='italic'>"It has a good reputation."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower.</p>
<hr>

<h2>XVI</h2>
<p>So then the seventh planet was the Earth.</p>
<p>The Earth is not just an ordinary planet! One can count, there, 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among thspan class='italic'), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men--that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lamps.</p>
<p>Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid spectacle. The movspan class='italic'ents of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera. First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia. Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep. Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings. After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe; then those of South America; then those of South America; then those of North America. And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage. It would be magnificent.</p>
<p>Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole--only these two would live free from toil and care: they would be busy twice a year.
</p>
<hr>

<h2>XVII</h2>
<p>When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a little from the truth. I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters. And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it. Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth. If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assspan class='italic'bly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide. All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet.</p>
<p>The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell thspan class='italic' that. They imagine that they fill a great deal of space. They fancy thspan class='italic'selves as important as the baobabs. You should advise thspan class='italic', then, to make their own calculations. They adore figures, and that will please thspan class='italic'. But do not waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary. You have, I know, confidence in me.</p>
<p>When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people. He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, flashed across the sand.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Good evening,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince courteously.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Good evening,"</span class='italic'> said the snake.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What planet is this on which I have come down?"</span class='italic'> asked the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"This is the Earth; this is Africa,"</span class='italic'> the snake answered.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Ah! Then there are no people on the Earth?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"This is the desert. There are no people in the desert. The Earth is large,"</span class='italic'> said the snake.</p>
<p>The little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I wonder,"</span class='italic'> he said, <span class='italic'>"whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again... Look at my planet. It is right there above us. But how far away it is!"</span class='italic'></p>
<img src="img\boyandsun.jpg" alt="Boy and sun">
<p><span class='italic'>"It is beautiful,"</span class='italic'> the snake said. <span class='italic'>"What has brought you here?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I have been having some trouble with a flower,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Ah!"</span class='italic'> said the snake.</p>
<p>And they were both silent.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Where are the men?"</span class='italic'> the little prince at last took up the conversation again. <span class='italic'>"It is a little lonely in the desert..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p> <span class='italic'>"It is also lonely among men," </span class='italic'> the snake said.</p>
<p>The little prince gazed at him for a long time.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You are a funny animal,"</span class='italic'> he said at last. <span class='italic'>"You are no thicker than a finger..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But I am more powerful than the finger of a king,"</span class='italic'> said the snake.</p>
<p>The little prince smiled.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You are not very powerful. You haven't even any feet. You cannot even travel..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I can carry you farther than any ship could take you,"</span class='italic'> said the snake.</p>
<p>He twined himself around the little prince's ankle, like a golden bracelet.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Whomever I touch, I send back to the earth from whence he came,"</span class='italic'> the snake spoke again. <span class='italic'>"But you are innocent and true, and you come from a star..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>The little prince made no reply.</p>
<p> <span class='italic'>"You move me to pity--you are so weak on this Earth made of granite," </span class='italic'> the snake said. <span class='italic'>"I can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own planet. I can--"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Oh! I understand you very well,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince. <span class='italic'>"But why do you always speak in riddles?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I solve thspan class='italic' all,"</span class='italic'> said the snake.</p>
<p>And they were both silent.</p>
<img src="img\boyandstar.jpg" alt="Boy and Star">
<hr>

<h2>XVIII</h2>
<p>The little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower. It was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at all.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Good morning,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Good morning,"</span class='italic'> said the flower.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Where are the men?"</span class='italic'> the little prince asked, politely.</p>
<p>The flower had once seen a caravan passing.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Men?"</span class='italic'> she echoed. <span class='italic'>"I think there are six or seven of thspan class='italic' in existence. I saw thspan class='italic', several years ago. But one never knows where to find thspan class='italic'. The wind blows thspan class='italic' away. They have no roots, and that makes their life very difficult."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Goodbye,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Goodbye,"</span class='italic'> said the flower.</p>
<img src="img\flower.jpg" alt="Flower">
<hr>

<h2>XIX</h2>
<p>After that, the little prince climbed a high mountain. The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes, which came up to his knees. And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool. <span class='italic'>"From a mountain as high as this one,"</span class='italic'> he said to himself, <span class='italic'>"I shall be able to see the whole planet at one glance, and all the people..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Good morning,"</span class='italic'> he said courteously.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Good morning--Good morning--Good morning,"</span class='italic'> answered the echo.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Who are you?"</span class='italic'> said the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Who are you--Who are you--Who are you?"</span class='italic'> answered the echo.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Be my friends. I am all alone,"</span class='italic'> he said.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I am all alone--all alone--all alone,"</span class='italic'> answered the echo.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What a queer planet!"</span class='italic'> he thought. <span class='italic'>"It is altogether dry, and altogether pointed, and altogether harsh and forbidding. And the people have no imagination. They repeat whatever one says to thspan class='italic'... On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak..."</span class='italic'></p>
<img src="img\rockgrey.jpg" alt="Rock grey">
<hr>
<h2>XX</h2>
<p>But it happened that after walking for a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the little prince at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the abodes of men.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Good morning,"</span class='italic'> he said.</p>
<p>He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Good morning,"</span class='italic'> said the roses.</p>
<p>The little prince gazed at thspan class='italic'. They all looked like his flower.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Who are you?"</span class='italic'> he dspan class='italic'anded, thunderstruck.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"We are roses,"</span class='italic'> the roses said.</p>
<p>And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of thspan class='italic', all alike, in one single garden!</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"She would be very much annoyed," he said to himself, "if she should see that... She would cough most dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at. And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life--for if I did not do that, to humble myself also, she would really allow herself to die..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>Then he went on with his reflections: <span class='italic'>"I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees--and one of thspan class='italic' perhaps extinct forever... That doesn't make me a very great prince..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And he lay down in the grass and cried.</p>
<img src="img\boyandwall.jpg" alt="Boy and wall">
<hr>

<h2>XXI</h2>
<p>It was then that the fox appeared.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Good morning,"</span class='italic'> said the fox.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Good morning,"</span class='italic'> the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I am right here,"</span class='italic'> the voice said, <span class='italic'>"under the apple tree."</span class='italic'></p>
<img src="img\boyfeild.jpg" alt="Boy on feild">
<p><span class='italic'>"Who are you?" asked the little prince, and added, "You are very pretty to look at."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I am a fox,"</span class='italic'> the fox said.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Come and play with me,"</span class='italic'> proposed the little prince. <span class='italic'>"I am so unhappy."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I cannot play with you,"</span class='italic'> the fox said. <span class='italic'>"I am not tamed."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Ah! Please excuse me,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince.</p>
<p>But, after some thought, he added:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What does that mean--'tame'?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><><span class='italic'>"You do not live here,"</span class='italic'> said the fox. <span class='italic'>"What is it that you are looking for?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I am looking for men,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince. <span class='italic'>"What does that mean--'tame'?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"No,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince. <span class='italic'>"I am looking for friends. What does that mean--'tame'?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is an act too often neglected,"</span class='italic'> said the fox. <span class='italic'>"It means to establish ties."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"'To establish ties'?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Just that," said the fox. "To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I am beginning to understand,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince. <span class='italic'>"There is a flower... I think that she has tamed me..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is possible,"</span class='italic'> said the fox. <span class='italic'>"On the Earth one sees all sorts of things."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Oh, but this is not on the Earth!"</span class='italic'> said the little prince.</p>
<p>The fox sespan class='italic'ed perplexed, and very curious.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"On another planet?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Yes."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Are there hunters on that planet?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"No."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Ah, that is interesting! Are there chickens?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"No."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Nothing is perfect,"</span class='italic'> sighed the fox.</p>
<p>But he came back to his idea.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"My life is very monotonous," the fox said. "I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.</p>
<img src="img\boyellow.jpg" alt="Boy">
<p><span class='italic'>"Please--tame me!"</span class='italic'> he said.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I want to, very much,"</span class='italic'> the little prince replied. <span class='italic'>"But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"One only understands the things that one tames,"</span class='italic'> said the fox. <span class='italic'>"Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What must I do, to tame you?"</span class='italic'> asked the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'><span class='italic'>"You must be very patient,"</span class='italic'> replied the fox. <span class='italic'>"First you will sit down at a little distance from me--like that--in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day..."</span class='italic'></span class='italic'></p>
<p>The next day the little prince came back.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It would have been better to come back at the same hour,"</span class='italic'> said the fox. <span class='italic'>"If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper rites..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What is a rite?"</span class='italic'> asked the little prince.</p>
<img src="img\mangun.jpg" alt="Man and gun">
<p><span class='italic'>"Those also are actions too often neglected,"</span class='italic'> said the fox. <span class='italic'>"They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near--</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Ah,"</span class='italic'> said the fox, <span class='italic'>"I shall cry."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is your own fault,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince. <span class='italic'>"I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Yes, that is so,"</span class='italic'> said the fox.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But now you are going to cry!"</span class='italic'> said the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Yes, that is so,"</span class='italic'> said the fox.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Then it has done you no good at all!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It has done me good,"</span class='italic'> said the fox, <span class='italic'>"because of the color of the wheat fields."</span class='italic'> And then he added:</p>
<p> <span class='italic'>"Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret."</span class='italic'> </p>
<p>The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You are not at all like my rose,"</span class='italic'> he said. <span class='italic'>"As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And the roses were very much span class='italic'barassed.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You are beautiful, but you are span class='italic'pty,"</span class='italic'> he went on. <span class='italic'>"One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you--the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or ever sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And he went back to meet the fox.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Goodbye,"</span class='italic'> he said.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Goodbye,"</span class='italic'> said the fox. <span class='italic'>"And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What is essential is invisible to the eye,"</span class='italic'> the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to rspan class='italic'span class='italic'ber.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is the time I have wasted for my rose--"</span class='italic'> said the little prince, so that he would be sure to rspan class='italic'span class='italic'ber.</p>
<p>i
    "Men have forgotten this truth," said the fox. <span class='italic'>"But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I am responsible for my rose,"</span class='italic'> the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to rspan class='italic'span class='italic'ber.</p>

<h2>XXII</h2>
<p><span class='italic'>"Good morning,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Good morning",</span class='italic'> said the railway switchman.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What do you do here?"</span class='italic'> the little prince asked.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I sort out travelers, in bundles of a thousand"</span class='italic'>, said the switchman. <span class='italic'>"I send off the trains that carry thspan class='italic': now to the right, now to the left."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman's cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"They are in a great hurry,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince. <span class='italic'>"What are they looking for?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Not even the locomotive engineer knows that,"</span class='italic'> said the switchman.</p>
<p>And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Are they coming back already?"</span class='italic'> dspan class='italic'anded the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"These are not the same ones,"</span class='italic'> said the switchman. <span class='italic'>"It is an exchange."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Were they not satisfied where they were?"</span class='italic'> asked the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"No one is ever satisfied where he is,"</span class='italic'> said the switchman.</p>
<p>And they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Are they pursuing the first travelers?"</span class='italic'> dspan class='italic'anded the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"They are pursuing nothing at all,"</span class='italic'> said the switchman. <span class='italic'>"They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Only the children know what they are looking for,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince. <span class='italic'>"They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to thspan class='italic'; and if anybody takes it away from thspan class='italic', they cry..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"They are lucky,"</span class='italic'> the switchman said.</p>
<hr>

<h2>XXIII</h2>
<p><span class='italic'>"Good morning,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Good morning,"</span class='italic'> said the merchant.</p>
<p>This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Why are you selling those?"</span class='italic'> asked the little prince.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Because they save a trspan class='italic'endous amount of time,"</span class='italic'> said the merchant. <span class='italic'>"Computations have been made by experts. With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Anything you like..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"As for me," said the little prince to himself, "if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water."
</span class='italic'></p>
<hr>

<h2>XXIV</h2>
<p>It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Ah,"</span class='italic'> I said to the little prince, <span class='italic'>"these mspan class='italic'ories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"My friend the fox--"</span class='italic'> the little prince said to me.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Why not?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Because I am about to die of thirst..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend..."</span class='italic'><span class='italic'>"He has no way of guessing the danger,"</span class='italic'> I said to myself. <span class='italic'>"He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I am thirsty, too. Let us look for a well..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking.</p>
<p>When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at thspan class='italic' as if I were in a dream. The little prince's last words came reeling back into my mspan class='italic'ory:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Then you are thirsty, too?"</span class='italic'> I dspan class='italic'anded.</p>
<p>But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Water may also be good for the heart..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him.</p>
<p>He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I replied, <span class='italic'>"Yes, that is so."</span class='italic'> And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The desert is beautiful,"</span class='italic'> the little prince added.</p>
<p>And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams...</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What makes the desert beautiful,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince, <span class='italic'>"is that somewhere it hides a well..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart...</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Yes,"</span class='italic'> I said to the little prince. <span class='italic'>"The house, the stars, the desert--what gives thspan class='italic' their beauty is something that is invisible!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I am glad,"</span class='italic'> he said, <span class='italic'>"that you agree with my fox."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It sespan class='italic'ed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It sespan class='italic'ed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trspan class='italic'bled in the wind, and I said to myself: <span class='italic'>"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: <span class='italic'>"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..." </span class='italic'> And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</p>
<p>And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak.</p>
<img src="img\something.jpg" alt="Something">
<hr>

<h2>XXV</h2>
<p> <span class='italic'>"Men," said the little prince, "set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And he added:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is not worth the trouble..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara. The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand. This one was like a well in a village. But there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming...</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is strange,"</span class='italic'> I said to the little prince. <span class='italic'>"Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Do you hear?"</span class='italic'> said the little prince. <span class='italic'>"We have wakened the well, and it is singing..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I did not want him to tire himself with the rope.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Leave it to me," I said. "It is too heavy for you."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there--happy, tired as I was, over my achievspan class='italic'ent. The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trspan class='italic'bling water.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I am thirsty for this water,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince. <span class='italic'>"Give me some of it to drink..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And I understood what he had been looking for.</p>
<p>I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The men where you live,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince, <span class='italic'>"raise five thousand roses in the same garden--and they do not find in it what they are looking for."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"They do not find it,"</span class='italic'> I replied.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Yes, that is true,"</span class='italic'> I said.</p>
<p>And the little prince added:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I had drunk the water. I breathed easily. At sunrise the sand is the color of honey. And that honey color was making me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense of grief?</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You must keep your promise,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What promise?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You know--a muzzle for my sheep... I am responsible for this flower..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked thspan class='italic' over, and laughed as he said:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Your baobabs--they look a little like cabbages."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Oh!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I had been so proud of my baobabs!</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Your fox--his ears look a little like horns; and they are too long."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And he laughed again.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You are not fair, little prince,"</span class='italic'> I said. <span class='italic'>"I don't know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Oh, that will be all right,"</span class='italic'> he said, <span class='italic'>"children understand."</span class='italic'></p>
<img src="img\pit.jpg" alt="Pit">
<p>So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it to him my heart was torn.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You have plans that I do not know about,"</span class='italic'> I said.</p>
<p>But he did not answer me. He said to me, instead:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You know--my descent to the earth... Tomorrow will be its anniversary."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>Then, after a silence, he went on:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I came down very near here."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And he flushed.</p>
<p>And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question, however, occurred to me:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you--a week ago--you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on the your back to the place where you landed?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>The little prince flushed again.</p>
<p>And I added, with some hesitancy:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Perhaps it was because of the anniversary?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>The little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions--but when one flushes does that not mean <span class='italic'>"Yes"</span class='italic'>?</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Ah,"</span class='italic'> I said to him, <span class='italic'>"I am a little frightened--"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>But he interrupted me.</p>
<p>"Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for you here. Come back tomorrow evening..."</p>
<p>But I was not reassured. I rspan class='italic'span class='italic'bered the fox. One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed...</p>
<hr>

<h2>XXVI</h2>
<p>Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall. When I came back from my work, the next evening, I saw from some distance away my little price sitting on top of a wall, with his feet dangling. And I heard him say:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Then you don't rspan class='italic'span class='italic'ber. This is not the exact spot."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>Another voice must have answered him, for he replied to it:</p>
<p> <span class='italic'>"Yes, yes! It is the right day, but this is not the place."</span class='italic'> </p>
<p>I continued my walk toward the wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone. The little prince, however, replied once again:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"-Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the sand. You have nothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I was only twenty meters from the wall, and I still saw nothing.</p>
<p>After a silence the little prince spoke again:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You have good poison? You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Now go away,"</span class='italic'> said the little prince. <span class='italic'>"I want to get down from the wall."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall--and I leaped into the air. There before me, facing the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end. Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back. But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones.</p>
<p>I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What does this mean?" I dspan class='italic'anded. "Why are you talking with snakes?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his tspan class='italic'ples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone's rifle...</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine,"</span class='italic'> he said. <span class='italic'>"Now you can go back home--"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"How do you know about that?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope.</p>
<p>He made no answer to my question, but he added:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I, too, am going back home today..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>Then, sadly--</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is much farther... It is much more difficult..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I realized clearly that something extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it sespan class='italic'ed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him...</p>
<p>His look was very serious, like some one lost far away.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I have your sheep. And I have the sheep's box. And I have the muzzle..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And he gave me a sad smile.</p>
<p>I waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little by little.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Dear little man,"</span class='italic'> I said to him, <span class='italic'>"you are afraid..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>He was afraid, there was no doubt about that. But he laughed lightly.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I shall be much more afraid this evening..."</span class='italic'></p>
<img src="img\wall.jpg" alt="Wall">
<p>Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Little man,"</span class='italic'> I said, <span class='italic'>"I want to hear you laugh again."</span class='italic'>But he said to me:</p>
<p>"Tonight, it will be a year... My star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago..."</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Little man,"</span class='italic'> I said, <span class='italic'>"tell me that it is only a bad dream--this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Yes, I know..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Yes, I know..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It is just as it is with the water. Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music. You rspan class='italic'span class='italic'ber--how good it was."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Yes, I know..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"And at night you will look up at the stars. Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found. It is better, like that. My star will just be one of the stars, for you. And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens... they will all be your friends. And, besides, I am going to make you a present..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>He laughed again.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Ah, little prince, dear little prince! I love to hear that laughter!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"That is my present. Just that. It will be as it was when we drank the water..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What are you trying to say?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"All men have the stars," he answered, "but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problspan class='italic's. For my businessman they were wealth. But all these stars are silent. You--you alone--will have the stars as no one else has thspan class='italic'--"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"What are you trying to say?"</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of thspan class='italic' I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night... You--only you--will have stars that can laugh!"</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And he laughed again.</p>
<img src="img\boyinfield.jpg" alt="Boy in feild">
<p><span class='italic'>"And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure... And your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to thspan class='italic', 'Yes, the stars always make me laugh!' And they will think you are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And he laughed again.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Tonight--you know... Do not come."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I shall not leave you,"</span class='italic'> I said.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I shall look as if I were suffering. I shall look a little as if I were dying. It is like that. Do not come to see that. It is not worth the trouble..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I shall not leave you."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>But he was worried.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I tell you--it is also because of the snake. He must not bite you. Snakes--they are malicious creatures. This one might bite you just for fun..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>"I shall not leave you."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>But a thought came to reassure him:</p>
<p> <span class='italic'>"It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite."</span class='italic'> </p>
<img src="img\boystar.jpg" alt="Boy and star">
<p>That night I did not see him set out on his way. He got away from me without making a sound. When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step. He said to me merely:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Ah! You are there..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And he took me by the hand. But he was still worrying.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I said nothing.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You understand... it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I said nothing.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I said nothing.</p>
<p>He was a little discouraged. But he made one more effort:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You know, it will be very nice. I, too, shall look at the stars. All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I said nothing.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"That will be so amusing! You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And he too said nothing more, becuase he was crying...</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"Here it is. Let me go on by myself."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>And he sat down, because he was afraid. Then he said, again:</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"You know--my flower... I am responsible for her. And she is so weak! She is so naďve! She has four thorns, of no use at all, to protect herself against all the world..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer.</p>
<p><span class='italic'>"There now--that is all ..."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>He still hesitated a little; then he got up. He took one step. I could not move.</p>
<p>There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle. He rspan class='italic'ained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because of the sand.</p>

<h2>XXVII</h2>
<p>And now six years have already gone by... I have never yet told this story. The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive. I was sad, but I told thspan class='italic': <span class='italic'> "I am tired."</span class='italic'></p>
<p>Now my sorrow is comforted a little. That is to say--not entirely. But I know that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak. It was not such a heavy body... and at night I love to listen to the stars. It is like five hundred million little bells...</p>
<p>But there is one extraordinary thing... when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add the leather strap to it. He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower...</p>
<p>At one time I say to myself: <span class='italic'>"Surely not! The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully..."</span class='italic'> Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars.</p>
<p>But at another time I say to myself: <span class='italic'> "At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is enough! On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night..."</span class='italic'> And then the little bells are changed to tears...</p>
<p>Here, then, is a great mystery. For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has--yes or no?--eaten a rose...</p>
<p>Look up at the sky. Ask yourselves: is it yes or no? Has the sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes...</p>
<p>And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!</p>
<img src="img\star.jpg" alt="Star">
<p><span class='italic'>This is, to me, the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world. It is the same as that on the preceding page, but I have drawn it again to impress it on your mspan class='italic'ory. It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth, and disappeared.</span class='italic'></p>
<p><span class='italic'>Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognize it in case you travel some day to the African desert. And, if you should come upon this spot, please do not hurry on. Wait for a time, exactly under the star. Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden hair and who refuses to answer questions, you will know who he is. If this should happen, please comfort me. Send me word that he has come back.</span class='italic'></p>
